# Movies ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Project Overview
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming movies and tv shows on Amazing Prime, the world's largest online retailer. The Amazing Prime Video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low-budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. To inspire the team, have some fun, and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon, providing a clean dataset of movie data and asking participants to predict the popular shows. As a member of the Amazing Prime Video team, I was tasked with creating the datasets for the hackathon. There are two data sources: a scrape of Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 and rating data from the MovieLens website. I've **extracted** the data from the two sources, **transformed** it into one clean dataset, and **loaded** the dataset into a SQL table.

Extract, Transform, and Load, also known as ETL, is a popular procedure that involves gathering, manipulating, and inserting data into a final destination.
